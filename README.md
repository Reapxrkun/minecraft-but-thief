Minecraft, but a thief steals your items
Hello user,
This is a plugin I made for Minecraft 1.15.2.
By the way, I did use a tutorial because I'm not that good at coding. I did, however change it up a bit so it isn't just straight up copying. Thanks CodedRed!
This was made by me to make Minecraft harder.
When placing a crafting table, there is a 10% chance of a thief stealing your items.
To install, follow these steps:
1. Extract the folder that the plugin is in.
2. Put it in the plugins folder in your Spigot server.
3. Type /rl in-game or just rl in your server console.
